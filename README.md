# About

This program made of Python 3 and Qt 5 through PyQt5. I tried to make it
simple as possible, so new Python and Qt 5 programmers can edit it easily. If you
have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me on [abbodmar@gmail.com](mailto:abbodmar@gmail.com?subject=Charts%20Finder)

I hope you enjoy the program as much as I enjoyed while making it.
