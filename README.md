# About

This program made of a years of self-learning Python, GTK + 3. I tried to make it
simple as possible, so new Python and GTK 3 programmers can edit it easily. If you
have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact me on abbodmar@gmail.com.

I hope you enjoy the program as much as I enjoyed while making it.
